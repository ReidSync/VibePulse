# VibePulse

**`VibePulse`** is a mood journal application that runs on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Description
This uses the [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) to provide support for both Android and iOS platforms through a single project with partially shared code like data models, business logic, and some common resources. Plans are in progress to extend this support to all platforms in the future.
